Case Study 0 3
Artificial Neural Network
Bob has started his own mobile company. He wants to give tough fight to big companies like
Apple, Samsung etc.
He does not know how to estimate price of mobiles his company creates. In this competitive
mobile phone market, you cannot simply assume things. To solve this problem, he collects sales
data of mobile phones of various companies.
Bob wants to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone (eg:- RAM, Internal
Memory etc) and its selling price. But he is not so good at Machine Learning. Create an artificial
neural network-based classifier to help Bob.
Data and class labels are available in mobile_price_classification.csv file. Use price_range
column as label and remaining columns as data.
